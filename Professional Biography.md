## Co-op Work Experience
### Software Engineer - Idaho National Laboratory ( 2020.05.01 - present )
I have been co-oping with the INL since my first co-op rotation (Summer 2020) and have completed all four of my 
co-op rotations with them. I work primarily in the Software Engineering Team at the Materials and Fuels Complex,
which handles the development and maintenance of applications used to study and track nuclear material.
Specifically, I have:

* Designed software that allows for modern interfacing with legacy technologies.
* Developed modern web applications that allow for backwards compatibility with older computer systems.
* Maintained databases and systems that work with critical data.
* Implemented automated testing and deployment for large-scale software projects.
* Communicated with stakeholders to determine application requirements and restrictions.
* Collaborated with various team members on a daily basis across multiple projects.

### Technical Skills
* **Programming** - Ruby (w/Rails), C, C++, Assembly (x86), FORTRAN, Python \
* **Web Development** - Typescript, HTML, SCSS \
* **Database Programming** - SQL, Redis (w/Sidekiq)

## Project Sought
* The project I will be completing during my capstone involves creating a hand-held, paperless cave surveying device.
* The purpose of this capstone is to create an open-source, simple, and affordable option for surveying to cavers across the world. 
* In more specific detail, I will be creating both a software API in order to read/write data from the sensors, and designing the
hardware to withstand the harsh conditions of caving, such as being: sturdy, water/dust-resistant, and power efficient.
