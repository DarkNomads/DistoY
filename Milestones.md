# Milestones

## 1. Sensor/Accessory Selection
<ul>
  <b>Description</b>: Select the microcontroller, sensors, battery, physical connectors, I/O, etc. needed for the device.
  <br/>
  <b>Deliverable(s)</b>: Order list all of the physical components.
</ul>

## 2. Physical Device Prototyping
<ul>
  <b>Description</b>: Assemble the sensors and other components for the device into a workable prototype.
  <br/>
  <b>Deliverable(s)</b>: All sensors and major components connected via a breadboard.
</ul>

## 3. Sensor API Implementation
<ul>
  <b>Description</b>: Design the API to control sending commands to each sensor, as well as retrieving the values from each sensor.
  <br/>
  <b>Deliverable(s)</b>: A functional API that can interact with the device's sensors.
</ul>

## 4. Measurement/Calibration Implementation
<ul>
  <b>Description</b>: Design the data processor component of the software, and implement the functionality for taking a measurement and calibrating the appropriate sensors.
  <br/>
  <b>Deliverable(s)</b>: A functional piece of software that interfaces with the Sensor API to perform measuring and calibration.
</ul>

## 5. I/O Implementation
<ul>
  <b>Description</b>: Design the physical I/O for the device, as well as the software needed to translate this into software commands.
  <br/>
  <b>Deliverable(s)</b>: A device with working I/O.
</ul>

## 6. Storage and Metadata Implementation
<ul>
  <b>Description</b>: Implement storage capability for the device, as well as adding additional metadata to the measurements.
  <br/>
  <b>Deliverable(s)</b>: Device memory can store and retrieve formatted data through the software.
</ul>

## 7. Functionality Testing
<ul>
  <b>Description</b>: Test the accuracy and functionality of the software/sensors, and refine design until it is within correct tolerances.
  <br/>
  <b>Deliverable(s)</b>: A device with completed software.
</ul>

## 8. Environmental Testing
<ul>
  <b>Description</b>: Test the prototype in various cave or cave-like conditions, and determine necessary changes for the final design.
  <br/>
  <b>Deliverable(s)</b>: A list of tests performed and improvements for the physical design of the device.
</ul>

## 9. Final Physical Device Design
<ul>
  <b>Description</b>: Using data collected from the environmental testing milestone, design and build the device according to final specifications.
  <br/>
  <b>Deliverable(s)</b>: A finished product that can be used in cave-surveying scenarios. 
</ul>
