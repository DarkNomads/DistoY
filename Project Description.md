## Project Abstract
DistoY is a cave surveying device aimed at providing cavers with a larger variety of functionality for surveying at a much lower cost\
than current products on the market. The DistoY will allow for taking distance measurements that can also record angles, track cardinal\
direction, and store data for later use. Furthermore, it will also be built to survive in the harsh conditions of caves, such as being\
dropped from heights, exposed to lots of dust, cold temperatures, and wetness or submersion in water. 

## Project Description
The purpose of this project is to provide a cheaper and more reliable surveying device to cavers. The current solutions that exist are\
either extremely expensive, lacking in features, or both. The aim of the DistoY is to create an API for commonly available sensors\
that is able to deliver vital features, such as distance measurement, angle measurement, and cardinal direction tracking. It also\
aims to allow for the storage of data for processing at a later date. Since this API will be publicly available and well-documented,\
the goal is for future feature development that can either completed by myself or others in the caving community. Finally, this project\
also includes the development of a physical design that is able to limit the harsh effects that caving may have on sensitive electronics,\
such as being dropped from heights, exposure to large amounts of dust, cold temperatures, and wet environments. The goal is for this device\
to be cave-ready and feature-rich so that it will have real application in the surveying of both new and existing caves.
