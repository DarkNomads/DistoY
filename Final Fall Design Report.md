# Final Report

## Project Abstract
DistoY is a cave surveying device aimed at providing cavers with a larger variety of functionality for surveying at a much lower cost\
than current products on the market. The DistoY will allow for taking distance measurements that can also record angles, track cardinal\
direction, and store data for later use. Furthermore, it will also be built to survive in the harsh conditions of caves, such as being\
dropped from heights, exposed to lots of dust, cold temperatures, and wetness or submersion in water.
