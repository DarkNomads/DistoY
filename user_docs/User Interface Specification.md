# User Interface Specification

## Specification
This project has two main interfaces for the user to use. The first are the sensor logs, which allows the user to read what is happening
inside the simulated sensors in real-time. The second is the interactive device controller, which allows the user to issue commands to
the sensors simulations, save data, and calibrate the sensors. Each sensor, as well as the device controller, runs in its own
separate terminal. If you are unsure of how to setup and use these interfaces, please reference the [User Manual](https://github.com/DarkNomads/DistoY/blob/4391f5ecf530f11e3e76aa20a8bf5aeaff96503a/user_docs/user_manual.md).
