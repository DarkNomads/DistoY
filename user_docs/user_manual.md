## 1. Getting Started
### What is the DistoY?
The DistoY is a cave surveying device aimed at providing cavers with a larger variety of functionality for surveying at a much lower cost than current products on the market. The DistoY will allow for taking distance measurements that can also record angles, track cardinal direction, and store data for later use. Furthermore, it will also be built to survive in the harsh conditions of caves, such as being dropped from heights, exposed to lots of dust, cold temperatures, and wetness or submersion in water.

### How can I try it?
Currently, the DistoY uses simulated sensors and a standalone program in order to simulate how the physical would work in the real world. You can try out this simulation by following this guide and setting up the sensor simulations and device controller on your own computer.

### System Requirements
To use run the DistoY simulation code, you must have access to a computer which either runs on a Linux, or can have software installed to emulate a Linux environment. Linux and Mac machines will work natively, and Windows machines will need additional software.

## 2. Environment Setup

### Linux & Mac machines
If you have either a Mac or Linux machine, you can skip to the next section.

### Windows machines
1. First you will need to install an Ubuntu (or any Linux) environment. I recommend going to the Windows Store and selecting 'Get' on the Ubuntu environment there:
[Add Image]

2. You will then need to clone this git repository into your Ubuntu environment:
[Add Image]

3. Your environment is now setup and you can move on to running the simulations.
