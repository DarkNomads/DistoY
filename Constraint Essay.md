# Constraint Essay

## Environmental
Since this project deals with a device that is intended to be used outdoors, there are many environmental constraints 
that go into the design and selection of parts for this device. One of the main principles around caving and outdoors is
the idea of Leave No Trace (LNT). While a surveying device does not seem like it would cause any pollution by itself, some of the
components may. For example, certain batteries when damaged could cause toxic chemicals to be leaked into the envrionment, or
a plastic construction that gets damaged could leave behind microplastics in these caves and their ecosystems. Because of these
possible environmental impacts, selecting environmentally safe components will be extremely important, as well as choosing materials
that are less likely to lead to inadvertant pollution.

## Economic
Since this project deals with physical electronics that are not cheap, funding could be an issue for this project. While this project
is attempting to use affordable sensors and components, these can still be quite expensive without dedicated funding. I am currently
working on fundraising within the caving community, which is highly motivated in developing a new surveying device, and have set
aside personal funds to help start the project. Furthermore, shipping of components could also cause some unforseen delays in being
able to complete some milestones, as some milestones involve the physical assembly of these components. Should these components get
delayed, some milestones may need to be switched around in order to be efficient.

## Scope/Time
Unlike software-based projects, this project will require installing and arranging physical components throughout the course of its
lifetime. Despite this device does have a limited scope in terms of functionality, it will require a lot of testing in order to ensure
that it is able to withstand the harsh conditions of caving. While some of the testing can be performed anywhere, many physical tests
will need to be performed ideally in caves. Because of this, hitting milestones in time will be crucial so that I can arrange to bring
it into caves, which are mostly located about 2-3 hours away in Kentucky. I believe that the timeline for this project is very
reasonable, but finishing the final physical design could be dificult if certain milestones are delayed.
