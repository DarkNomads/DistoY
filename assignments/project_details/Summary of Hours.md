## Justification of Hours
Since this was an individual project, I chose to summarize the hours in relation to each milestone, or an other category for non-milestone hours. On average,
about 5 hours of work was done each week in accordance with a milestone.

### Fall Other Hours
Outlined the project repository and began drafted the project description. Wrote my individual capstone assignment and began gathering 
requirements for the project. Finished collecting user stories and created the design diagrams that guided the project design. Overall, these
hours mainly revolved around the assignments for the course.


### Milestone 1 - Sensor Selection
This milestone involved selecting which microcontroller, sensors, battery, physical connectors, and I/O that I would need to prototype the physical device.
This involved comparing cost, documentation, compatibility with microcontrollers, and other factors for each component. The longest components to decide on
were the HWT905-TTL and LRF60M-10PH sensors, but I ultimately decided the order these after some preliminary reading of their documentation. as they seemed
to be well designed. This milestone also involved looking at some useful code libraries for speeding up development, specifically learning NumPy for vector
mathematics.

### Milestone 2 - Device Simulation (Sensors)
